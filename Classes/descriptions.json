Basically participation grades and if you do them, there's basically no way to not get an A.",

Then you work on mostly SML and Prolog functions in your assingments. 3 tests (17% each), 1 presentation (10%), 7 assingments (39%). The presentation is with a group of 3, 20 minutes long, and about a lesser known programming language.",
            "Tips": "Take notes on the examples he uses in class. They usually appear again of the test. Just studying his slides isn't really adequate preperation for his tests. Also, start early on the presentation.",

            "Description": "This entire class is working on building a full-stack web application. You're graded based on sprints, participation, online at-home quizzes, and a final presentation. A sprint is a period of time to develop a feature basically. You work in a group of 5 and the presentation is 20 minutes long. This class is mostly just a participation grade and to see how well you follow directions. Definetly take advantage of the super generous opportunities that Layman throughout. If you do those things you're basically gauranteed an A.",
            "Tips": "Read the rubrics for each sprint, don't wait until the last minute to try and finish your code, take advantage of extra credit opportunities. I'd also recommend using the following tech stack: Vue.js (Composition API) front end, PostgreSQL Database, Python and Flask backend. It's the most beginner friendly and easiest for a 4 month long course imo. React, Java, and Spring Boot, might be too difficult for a beginner. Even if you know what you're doing, your teammates might not.",

            "Description": "50% of your class grade is one-paragraph long descrptions of what you did at your internship every week. The other 50% is making a poster to show at the computing showcase. This entire class is basically a super easy participation grade. At the computing showcase you just stand near your poster and people can come to your \"Stand\" and ask you questions about. You're not presenting to a group. Like 3 people come up to me during the two hours to ask me about my poster and internship. It's super easy and low stress.",
            "Tips": "Contact Shauana White at turners@uncw.edu to express interest in the class. You can't sign up for it like a regular class. Try to contact asap, as the process of signing up can take a little bit of time. It's pretty straight forward though.",
